# Functional_Prgramming_With_UnitTest-GoogleTest
1. A simple demo of Functional Programming with Unit Test by using GoogleTest in C++11/14
2. A lambda function is passed as argument to a templated funtion which calls again the (same) receieved function in the parameter.
3. Two unit test cases show how different funtional behaviour is achieved by functional programming technique 
   by just changing the lambda function which is passed as argument
